Yes, its a blog.

I'm going where many, many, **many** people have gone before.

On the flip-side, there's a lot to be written about many different topics.

Design Systems, Git, Drupal, and more.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
