Howdy.

As a Texan, I am told (often) I pretty much have to start with Howdy. Also, no, we do not check our horses at the border.

My name, as you might have guessed, is Charles Leverington (aka: Pedran or cleverington).

I am a near-Fanatical Drupal lover, (Self-Declared) Philosopher, Web Efficiency Designer, Aspiring Author, Think-tank, and Quality Specialist. I have worked for over a decade in both Quality Assurance and Online Development. I also has experience with design and customer module development in Drupal 5, Drupal 6, Drupal 7, Drupal Gardens (R.I.P.), and (soon) Drupal 8. To date, I have been a Contributor or Developer for three published websites, one Full-Stack Drupal design and deployment for a project-wide Intranet, and a massive multiple-site deployment for six separate Drupal installations pulling from the same customized Distribution.

I have written various fiction short stories, novellas, and even a couple of novels over the last decade and published a few in-progress fan fiction works on FanFiction.net \(aka: [Pedran](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/164598/Pedran "Pedran's FanFiction Pad") \).

Last, but certainly not least, I try to be an [A11Y](http://a11yproject.com/ "A11Y") and am actively engaged with the Drupal Diversity and Inclusion Workgroup. In Fall 2016, I assisted in converting the entire Google Doc for the draft into a fully functional (and linkable) GitBook using Markdown and a nice tweak to a Javascript tool: https://drupal-diversity.gitbooks.io/drupal-organizer-resources/content/.

If there's a mistake, let me know.
If I can make it better, let me know.
