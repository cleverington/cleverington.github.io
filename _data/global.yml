title: "Howdy. You've found the home of Charles Leverington."
description: "As a Texan, I am told (often) I pretty much have to start with Howdy. Also, no, we do not check our horses at the border.
My name, as you might have guessed, is Charles Leverington (aka: Pedran or cleverington).
I am a near-Fanatical Drupalist, (Self-Declared) Philosopher, Web Efficiency Designer, Aspiring Author, Think-tank, and Quality Specialist. I have worked for over a decade in both Quality Assurance and Online Development. I also has experience with design and customer module development in Drupal 6, Drupal 7, Drupal Gardens, and (soon) Drupal 8. To date, I have been a Contributor or Developer for three published websites and one Full-Stack Drupal design and deployment for a project-wide Intranet.
I have written various fiction short stories, novellas, and even a couple of novels over the last decade and published a few in-progress fan fiction works on FanFiction.net (aka: Pedran )."
